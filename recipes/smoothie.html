<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Beyond the perfect balance of flavors, there are also a lot of health benefits to appreciate in this recipe as well.
    Bananas, although high in carbohydrates and natural sugars, are also the perfect way to naturally boost your energy
    first thing in the morning. Bananas are also known for their balance of potassium and vitamin C, which is something
    all of our bodies need more than ever. The berries in this smoothie are lower in sugar and are packed with
    antioxidants. They compliment the chia seeds in this recipe as well to give your digestive system a rush of fiber to
    aid in overall weight loss.
