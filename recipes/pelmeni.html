<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pelmeni are traditional Russian meat-filled dumplings. Making pelmeni is favorite family pastime in the long winter
    months. These dumplings are a common convenience food - big batches can be frozen and quickly boiled or fried on
    demand.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Dough</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>
<h3>Filling</h3>
<ul>
    <li>18 oz ground beef</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp ice-cold water</li>
    <li>1 tbsp coarse salt</li>
    <li>freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine egg, vegetable oil, and salt in a measuring cup; add enough water to fill to 1 cup. Pour into a bowl,
        add 3 cups flour, and knead into a smooth, elastic dough. Cover with a kitchen towel and rest for 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour.</li>
    <li>Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix filling thoroughly by hand or using a
        fork.
    </li>
    <li>Roll out a portion of the dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface and cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a
        cookie cutter or a wine glass. Keep the rest of the dough covered with a towel to avoid drying out. Place 1/2 to
        1 teaspoon of filling on one side of the dough circle. Fold dough over and seal the edges using fingers, forming
        a crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining
        dough and filling. Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together.
    </li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer and drop small batches of frozen pelmeni into simmering
        water. Cook and stir until the meat is cooked and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking
        for an additional 5 minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.
    </li>
</ol>
