<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Tomato sauce is good, but it is so much better when it’s loaded with lentils and lots of veggies! This delicious
    sauce was inspired by Dreena Burton’s book, Plant-Powered Families. It’s delicious over zoodles, but it’s just as
    delicious over your favorite pasta, potatoes, rice, or even greens.
